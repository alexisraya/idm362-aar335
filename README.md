## Research
*I want to create a vitamin tracker app where users can track the vitamins they’re taking and get daily reminders to take their vitamins. It would base how much of each vitamin they needs on their weight and height. My target users would be young adults who are beginning to be aware of their health and want to stay on top of their vitamins and nutrients.*

The color scheme is very cool-toned with teals, greys, and blues. There are also pale red accents. There’s a dial that has an unsaturated color wheel as the background. It feels a little stale, but does what it needs to do. This isn’t an app I feel I can spend too much time on. Not much makes me feel welcomed it feel more like the extension of a doctor’s office. I wish there was a little

I think it overall does the job it needs to do. It gives daily reminders and tracks your vitamins but it doesn’t ask you for any metrics. For my target users, I want them to feel like they’re achieving a goal rather than completing a task. I would make the color scheme brighter and ask for personal metrics or even just a name to make it feel more personal to the user.

The text is very large. Each vitamin is associated with a color. The app lists every vitamin that you’re taking and overall is just a more colorful version of the health app with larger font. I initially wasn’t sure how to add my vitamin intake. You have to click on every vitamin to add your intake which may be a little counter-intuitive since a lot of people take multivitamins and probably aren’t willing to take time to add each individual vitamin.

This app doesn’t send notifications, which I think is necessary for an app like this. I also feel like having an interface that does list every vitamin would be preferred since the health app already does that for you. I think that I would make the interface look more like a tracker with some sort of progress bar. I also would make it easier to add vitamins.
